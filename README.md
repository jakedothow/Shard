# Shard
Shard is a DLL that you can inject into Fortnite to basically cheat. If you like you could update the sigs and make it work on latest, I think you'd have more fun making your own DLLs though.
I'm simply open sourcing this because I have no use it for it anymore.

# Ingame
My friends transformed my DLL into a local ingame DLL, if you want to check that out, it's on the `ingame` branch.
